# start-react

A simple setup for starting a React.js app. It has less moving parts than [create-react-app][cra] and in my opinion is easier to understand for those beginning to learn React.

Can be used as an environment to build a front-end only app or can be used as a starting place to build the backend as well using Node.js.

### Uses:
- [Express][express] for webserver (dev and production)
- [Webpack][webpack] (v3) for JavaScript bundling
- Sass for CSS pre-processing, specifically [node-sass][sass]
